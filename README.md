# T20-Cricket-Analysis-2022
This repository explores various aspects of T20 cricket matches played in 2022. The analysis aims to uncover insights into player performance, team strategies, and overall trends in the game.

## Data Source

The data for this project will be obtained from a reliable cricket data source, such as:

* ESPN Cricinfo (https://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/stats/index.html)
* Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (if a relevant T20 2022 dataset exists)
* Other public cricket data APIs (https://rapidapi.com/collection/cricket-api)

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

* `data`: This directory will store the raw T20 cricket data for 2022 in a suitable format (CSV, JSON, etc.).
* `analysis`: This directory will contain Python notebooks or scripts for performing data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
* `reports`: This directory will house any generated reports (visualizations, tables, etc.) summarizing the analysis findings.
* `documentation`: This directory (optional) can hold additional documentation, such as data dictionary or analysis methodology.

## Analysis Plan

Here's a preliminary outline of the planned analysis:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Address inconsistencies in data formats.
   - Create derived features if needed (e.g., batting/bowling averages, strike rates).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze batting and bowling performances across teams and players.
   - Identify top performers and trends in different aspects (runs scored, wickets taken, economy rates, etc.).
   - Explore relationships between variables (e.g., impact of toss on match outcomes).

3. **Statistical Modeling (Optional):**
   - Develop predictive models to forecast match outcomes or player performances (using techniques like logistic regression, random forests).

4. **Visualization:**
   - Create compelling visualizations (charts, graphs) to showcase the analysis findings.
   - Consider using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

## Technology :
* Power BI
  
   
## Tools 

This project will primarily leverage Python for data analysis and manipulation. Additional libraries may be used as needed:

* Pandas (data manipulation)
* NumPy (numerical computations)
* Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly (data visualization)
* Scikit-learn (machine learning, if applicable)
